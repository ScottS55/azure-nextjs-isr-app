Personalize app to being more than just a default - set up for experimentation.
Look into ISR configuration (LOCAL)

Look into personal project azure hosting options
Set up node js app server.
Look into deployment options. Not really worth paying for a devops pipeline if it's more than 5$ a month, so it might be azure cli city.
Deploy and run the server statically
Confirm that ISR works via postmanning the server.

Export templates and clean up. Probably want to store them in a separate repo. Maybe in the same to keep it simple. Maybe in another to pad the github.
Update the readme at some point.
